A simple, straightforward ruby script to sort music files and symlink to them in your music 
library which currently only supports mp4 and mp3 files.

usage:
$ sortMusic.rb [files...]

If anybody for some reason decides they want to use this, they will need to download
both eyeD3 and AtomicParsley.  They will probably also want to modify the global variables
in the beginning of the script, and depending on how adventurous they are, the methods
preprocessInfo and pathFromInfo.

Tested only on 64 bit Ubuntu 11.10
